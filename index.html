        <h3>Larson Middle School Named 2019 National School of Character</h3>
        <p>The Troy School District is pleased to announce that Character.org, a national advocate and leader for character in education, has named Larson Middle School a 2019 National School of Character, one of only 88 schools across the country to receive this important distinction. The program recognized Larson as a school that has demonstrated its use of character development to drive a positive impact on academics, student behavior and Larson’s cultural climate.</p>
        
        <p>Principal Joe Duda commended the entire Larson Community for coming together in support of character education. “This recognition is a result of a shared commitment to character and involves everyone at Larson: our students, our parents, and our staff. They clearly believe promoting and growing character is an important responsibility that has numerous positive effects on our school. Our staff have worked tirelessly over the past 6 years to deepen our understanding of character education and have improved our practices each year based on the valuable feedback we have received from School of Character Application Process.” Larson was designated a State School of Character back in 2018.</p>

        <p>
            The mission of Larson Middle School is to ensure learning for all members of the school community. Our vision is to remain an exemplary learning community that embraces innovation and is committed to continuous improvement. In order to support the mission and vision, our STRONG core values are resilience, respect, responsibility, and relationships. They represent ways to improve self-worth, personal relationships amongst peers and student to teacher relationships. Each year we re-evaluate our focus and areas of improvement determining how to better serve the Larson community.
        </p>
        <p>Larson staff is a learning community that values character education and adheres to the same core values that guide the students. Larson focuses on promoting pro-kindness rather than an anti-bullying sentiment. The STRONG model has had a dramatic impact over the course of the last four years reaching the hallways, classrooms, assemblies, social media, and LMS spirit wear. These items have helped establish a STRONG brand here at Larson. The emphasis of STRONG relationships with teachers and students permeates throughout teachers’ lessons and interactions within the hallways. Communication among staff, students and families has created a team environment where we are focused on each child’s success.</p>
